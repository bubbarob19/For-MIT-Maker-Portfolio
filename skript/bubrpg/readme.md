These are some skripts for one of my oldest servers, BubRPG. In particular, this is from a revamp I worked on for this server. I sadly don't have the original code and much of the new code because around the time I was working on this server, I bought a PC and switched to that from my parents' old Mac. These skripts are pretty large and messy, but I made some cool features like cooking, custom crafting, and brand new menus.
