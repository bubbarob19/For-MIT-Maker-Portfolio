This was the culmination of my skript journey, and the last server I ever used skript for. This game mode was a custom generator server, similar to a tycoon. Players would place down blocks called "gens," from which items would pop out. The core of the game mode consisted of selling these items for money, upgrading the gens, and building automated systems on a plot to make the whole process more efficient. There were also extra features too, such as fruit picking, fishing, and farming, which all provided the player with some unique benefit in pursuing it. If you want to see this server in action, check out the video I posted in the main readme.md file!
