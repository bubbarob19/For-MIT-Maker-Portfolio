This server was one of my largest skript projects. The gamemode was a mining/pvp based game mode where players would fight each other and mine resources to upgrade and become stronger. I wrote a lot of iconic and memorable code for this server. You will see the battlepass in the video and an old version of the gambling game from the video. The video shows a revamped version for my newest project, which I cannot share for exploit reasons, but they are relatively similar. This isn't quite as messy as BubRPG, but skripts are always all over the place.
